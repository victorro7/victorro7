# Hi, I'm Victor Osunji 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) on the AI/ML track and a Break Through Tech AI Fellow at Cornell Tech. My passion lies in architecting and deploying full-stack, production-grade generative AI solutions that solve tangible problems by making complex technology more intuitive and accessible.

My experience at companies like **IBM** and **Cisco** has centered on building end-to-end AI systems, from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines for technical documentation to AI chatbots that streamline engineering workflows. I love taking ideas from concept to reality, which is why I've also built my own scalable, multimodal AI platforms like **Klair** and **Raven** using Google Gemini, FastAPI, Next.js, and Google Cloud Platform.

My long-term ambition is to found my own AI-native company. I'm driven to learn how to build a product vision, navigate the trade-offs between technical perfection and market speed, and ultimately create a venture that is both technologically innovative and commercially viable.
